          <p class="article-p"><b>T</b>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs
            deep
            within everyone,
            even though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people
            are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much
            less than respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.
          </p>
          <p class="article-p">I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect?
            Respect is showing
            someone
            extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
